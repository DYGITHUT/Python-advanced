Basically, everything turns around the concept of *Data Frame* and using *SQL language* to query them. We will see how the data frame abstraction, very popular in other data analytics ecosystems (e.g. R and Python/Pandas), it is very powerfull when performing exploratory data analysis. In fact, it is very easy to express data queries when used together with the SQL language. Moreover, Spark distributes this column-based data structure transparently, in order to make the querying process as efficient as possible.      \n"," \n","This lab session will assume that you have uploaded two data files into cloud, and note down the address:\n","- mtcars.csv\n","- kddcup_data_10_percent-d8e1d.gz\n"]},{"metadata":{"id":"DI3J5Lclh3L1","colab_type":"text"},"cell_type":"markdown","source":["<a id = \"loadingdataframe\"></a>"]},{"metadata":{"id":"CwTeJHXPh3L2","colab_type":"text"},"cell_type":"markdown","source":["### 1.
